## About

Hello there. My name is Cesar Rebolledo. I am a software enginner. Since I can remember I always enjoyed tinkering with technology. Lately my passion has been taking older hardware and installing linux. Poke around and feel free to reach out to me at rebolledoces@gmail.com.

Thanks for stopping by! And since this is my person site repo, this is a living document.
